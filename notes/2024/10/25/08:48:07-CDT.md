# Getting the database up & running migrations

I'm quickly learning that the way I was trying to get the database up & schemas created was wrong.

I should be leveraging database migrations to create the schemas and tables.

The migrations should be run either as part of the application deployment process, or as part of the application startup process.

Maybe the most simple way to get it working for now is to run the migrations as part of the application startup process.

This way, I can just run the application and the database will be created and ready to go. There are potential pitfalls with this approach, but for now, it should be good enough.

## Getting Started

Let's first ask Claude about the best way to structure this, especially in regard to sequencing in the kubernetes deployment. 

For example, the database should be entirely ready before the application starts up.
