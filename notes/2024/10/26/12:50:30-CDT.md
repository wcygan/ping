# Bootstrap

Off of the initial bootstrap, we should see this:

```bash
skaffold run -p bootstrap
No tags generated
Starting test...
Starting deploy...
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
Deployments stabilized in 11.493417ms
You can also run [skaffold run --tail] to get the logs

kubectl get pods -n cnpg-system
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cnpg-cloudnative-pg-9b446b994-m5p7b   1/1     Running   0          13h
```

Once that is present, we should be able to run the remainder of the application via `skaffold dev`:

```bash
 - cluster.postgresql.cnpg.io/pg-cluster created
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
Deployments stabilized in 8.4945ms
 - role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cnpg-reader created
 - rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cnpg-reader-binding created
 - deployment.apps/server created
 - service/server created
 - horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/server-hpa created
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
 - deployment/server: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete
    - pod/server-7d944cdd95-hc989: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete
      > [server-7d944cdd95-hc989 wait-for-k8s] Waiting for CNPG cluster to be ready...
      > [server-7d944cdd95-hc989 wait-for-k8s] Waiting for cluster to be healthy...
    - pod/server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete
      > [server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw wait-for-k8s] Waiting for CNPG cluster to be ready...
      > [server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw wait-for-k8s] Waiting for cluster to be healthy...
    - pod/server-7d944cdd95-s5nc4: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete
      > [server-7d944cdd95-s5nc4 wait-for-k8s] Waiting for
```

At this point, Postgres is trying to initialize itself; once that process completes, we should see the servers coming up.
