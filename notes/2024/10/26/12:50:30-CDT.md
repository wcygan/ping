# Bootstrap

Off of the initial bootstrap, we should see this:

```bash
skaffold run -p bootstrap
No tags generated
Starting test...
Starting deploy...
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
Deployments stabilized in 11.493417ms
You can also run [skaffold run --tail] to get the logs

kubectl get pods -n cnpg-system
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cnpg-cloudnative-pg-9b446b994-m5p7b   1/1     Running   0          13h
```

Once that is present, we should be able to run the remainder of the application via `skaffold dev`:

```bash
 - cluster.postgresql.cnpg.io/pg-cluster created
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
Deployments stabilized in 8.4945ms
 - role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cnpg-reader created
 - rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cnpg-reader-binding created
 - deployment.apps/server created
 - service/server created
 - horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/server-hpa created

      > [server-7d944cdd95-hc989 wait-for-k8s] Waiting for cluster to be healthy...
    - pod/server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete

      > [server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw wait-for-k8s] Waiting for cluster to be healthy...
    - pod/server-7d944cdd95-s5nc4: waiting for init container wait-for-k8s to complete
      > [server-7d944cdd95-s5nc4 wait-for-k8s] Waiting for
```

At this point, Postgres is trying to initialize itself; once that process completes, we should see the servers coming up.

This is what it looks like when postgres is up, but the servers are still initializing:

```bash
 NAME↑                     PF  READY  STATUS      RESTARTS IP            NODE        AGE     │
│ pg-cluster-1              ●   1/1    Running            0 10.244.1.16   minikube    52s     │
│ pg-cluster-2              ●   1/1    Running            0 10.244.1.18   minikube    31s     │
│ pg-cluster-3              ●   1/1    Running            0 10.244.1.20   minikube    13s     │
│ server-7d944cdd95-hc989   ●   0/1    Init:0/3           0 10.244.1.15   minikube    57s     │
│ server-7d944cdd95-hpzlw   ●   0/1    Init:0/3           0 10.244.1.14   minikube    57s     │
│ server-7d944cdd95-s5nc4   ●   0/1    Init:0/3           0 10.244.1.13   minikube    57s 
```

## Why do we use `kubectl` in the configs for our infra?

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v4beta1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: ping-db-config
deploy:
  kubectl:
    flags:
      apply: ["--namespace=default"]
manifests:
  rawYaml:
    - secret.yaml
    - ping-db.yaml
```

We are using `deploy:kubectl:` to ensure that the manifests are applied by `kubectl`. I've ran into issues where the manifests *weren't* applied if I didn't do this, so I'm guessing that it needs to be structured this way to work like I expect.
