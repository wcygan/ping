Maybe you can just use version 1.13.0 for now.

## Scylla Operator 1.13.0

```bash
│ scylla              scylla-us-east-1-us-east-1a-0                  ●     0/3      Init:0/1                1 10.244.0.193      minikube      32s       │
│ scylla-manager      scylla-manager-758bf7f4df-mxw5n                ●     0/1      Running                 0 10.244.0.191      minikube      95s       │
│ scylla-manager      scylla-manager-manager-dc-manager-rack-0       ●     0/3      Pending                 0 n/a               n/a           32s      
```

It seems to take quite a while for the scylla pods to come online...

Just do the commands and wait a little bit to see what happens.
