# Pivoting on the Flink Sink

I originally planned to use ScyllaDB as a sink for the data that Flink processes, but honestly it has been too difficult to get the ScyllaDB Operators running on k8s.

To that end, I'm going to try something new.

I'll either use `redis` or `dragonfly` as a sink for the data that Flink processes. Hopefully, this will be easier to set up and manage.
